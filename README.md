SoleMates

## Overview



### Problem

We all know the struggle. You find a shoe online, only to discover it's too narrow, too wide, or just
plain uncomfortable. Generic sizing charts simply don't account for the beautiful variations in our
feet.

### User Profile


**Who will use Solemates:**

-   **Anyone Frustrated with Ill-Fitting Shoes:**  This is your core market. People tired of blisters, pinched toes, and general foot discomfort due to sizing issues are prime candidates.
-   **Fashion Enthusiasts with Unique Feet:**  Those who love shoes but have wide/narrow feet, high arches, or other features making standard sizing difficult.
-   **Athletes and Active Individuals:**  People who need shoes tailored to specific performance requirements alongside a proper fit.
-   **Busy Individuals:**  Anyone who wants to save time and hassle when shoe shopping, preferring a streamlined process.
-   **People with Foot Conditions:**  While not a primary focus, Solemates could potentially be helpful for those with bunions, plantar fasciitis, etc., as the detailed data may guide them towards comfort-focused brands
